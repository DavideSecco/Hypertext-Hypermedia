<!-- XSLT VS CSS -->
    CSS – Cascading Style Sheet
        ◦ style sheet determines the style or the appearance of tags (HTML or XML)
        ◦ we can define fonts, margins, colours, borders, …
    XSLT stylesheet
        ◦ a document that generates data based on XML document, the resulting 
        document may or may not contain formatting information
        ◦ a complete high-level language for manipulating an XML documents
        ◦ it does not replace existing programming languages but complements  them
    Advantages
        ◦ Independent of programming. Transformations are written in a separate 
        XSL file which is an XML document. 
        ◦ Output can be changed by simply modifying the transformations in an
        XSL file. No need to change any code. So Web designers can edit the 
        stylesheet and can see the change in the output quickly.
